# Specification Quality Checklist: Repository & Governance Evolution (Phase 2.0)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-01
**Feature**: [specs/002-repo-governance/spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

| Category | Items Checked | Passed | Failed |
|----------|---------------|--------|--------|
| Content Quality | 4 | 4 | 0 |
| Requirement Completeness | 8 | 8 | 0 |
| Feature Readiness | 4 | 4 | 0 |
| **Total** | **16** | **16** | **0** |

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/sp.plan`
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements clearly defined by user input
- Phase 2.0 explicitly excludes any application code, making scope well-bounded
- Technology references in CLAUDE.md content are appropriate since they describe context, not implementation

## Checklist Status: PASSED

All items passed validation. Specification is ready for planning phase.
