# Data Model: Repository & Governance Evolution (Phase 2.0)

**Feature**: 002-repo-governance
**Date**: 2026-01-01

---

## Overview

Phase 2.0 is a governance-only phase that introduces no application data models. This document exists for workflow completeness but contains no entity definitions.

## Entities

**None** - Phase 2.0 does not introduce any data entities.

## Rationale

Phase 2.0 scope explicitly excludes:
- Database implementation
- Backend API implementation
- Frontend UI implementation
- Any application logic or features

The phase focuses exclusively on:
- Repository structure
- Specification governance
- Claude Code context layering
- Documentation scaffolding

## Future Phases

Data models will be introduced in subsequent phases:
- **Phase 2.1**: Database Persistence Layer (Task, User entities)
- **Phase 2.2**: Authentication (User session, JWT claims)

*This document will remain empty for Phase 2.0 per specification scope.*
